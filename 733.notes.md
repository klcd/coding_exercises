# 733 Flood fill

As the flooding of the neighbouring field with a color is always a similiar step I chose a recursive approach.

For this we always need a **recursion step** and a **stopping condition**. 

There are two conditions for that the recursion should stop:
    - The next field is outside the image
    - The current field should not be repainted

Both these conditions are implemented in the shouldStop function.

The recursion step consists of moving up, down, right, left on the grid.

Additionally, if the new color is equal to the old color we do not have to do anything.
