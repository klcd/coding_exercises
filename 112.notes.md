# 112 Path sum

In order to determine the sums along the path we need to traverse the tree. Here I choose to use a depth-first-search (DFS) approach because as soon I find a path that fullfills the condition I want to stop searching. 

Two things are important here in the definition of the traverse function. Firstly, I chose to give the $cont$ variable as a reference. This means all recursions will write to the same place in memory. Secondly, I chose to give the target sum as a copy. This has the effect that within the traverse function it remains const after the current node value is deducted.

No if I find that we are at a leaf node of the tree I evaluate the cont variable and see if I want to continue. If not the recursion returns to the root call as all if statements are skipped due to common cont reference variable.

Time complexity as always for tree traversals O(N) where N is the number of nodes.:w
