# 20 Valid Parantheses

I choose to make this a little harder than necessary because I wanted it to work for string that contain other characters than paranthesis. 

Generally, the Idea is that a closing paranthesis must correspont to the last seen opening paranthesis. This can be nicely implemented by a stack, as it always give you O(1) access to the top element. 

Therefore I loop over the string and push all opening brackets to the stack. If I encounter a closing braket I obtain its corresponding opening braket via the unordered map and compare this one to the encountered closing bracket. If the do not match I return false immediately.

In the case that the loop finishes with returning I look at the size of the stack and if its empty the bracket are all in pairs.
