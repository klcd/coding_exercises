# Idea

The idea is that we want to gather candidates numbers $c_i$. Such that if the next value we look at is inside the group of candidates we can return the pair of numbers.

Therefore we want to safe $c_i = target -n_i$ for each encountered value $n_i$ in nums 

This alone would suffice to determine if we can build the target from two numbers. 

However we want to return the required indexes of the two numbers. To store the index we can use a hash map, where we use the key for the candidate number and the value for the index such that 

$$ cand[c_i] = i $$

If we now encounter a value $n_j$ that is a key to the hash map we can return the indexes as 

$$ \left\lbrace cand[n_j], j \right \rbrace $$
