# 26 Remove duplicates from sorted array

As we are not allowed to use extra memory we must use swaps. 


The idea is that we have one position for the next swap called "$inP$". Whenever we make an insertion we increase it by one.

Now we need to determine when to make a swap. Imagine we loop over the loop and have and index "$ind$"

If the number at "$ind$" is different from the number at "$inP$" we swap the numbers and increase "$inP$" by one. 

At the end the length of the valid array is exactly "$inP$".
